# Brendan McCaffrey's Personal Portfolio

This is a website I created when I was 17 years old, using a public template for Jekyll. It was a phenomenal learning experience as my first deep dive into HTML, CSS, Markdown, and even Git. I have updated the website here and there, but I will soon create a personal website using Ruby on Rails. Until then, check it out [Here](https://brendanmccaffrey.com/)
