The students come from a variety of schools. There are a couple from UVA (the sponsor of the program), and the rest are a mix of Michigan, Duke, Columbia, Florida, ect. There is one kid in my class that graduated from Columbia in 2016, worked in Real Estate Tech (i dont know exactly what that means) for a very successful startup, and is taking this course to pick up finance. My roommates are cool, we all get up around 8am every day and go to the gym in the Bay Hotel, which is a bout a block from where we are staying (as iX students we get free access). I went for a run today as well; I need to start running because the hotel gym isn't phenomenal.
