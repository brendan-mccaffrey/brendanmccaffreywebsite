I started the morning with a run, and then I tried to go surfing. For some reason, no other kids here seem interested (very weird) so I took an Uber to a rental shop at a big surf spot just 15 minutes away from where I am staying. Unfortunately, the conditions weren't optimal, and the rental place wasn't even open. 

Once I got back to my room, one of my roomates and I decided to hike up Table Mountain. I did some quick research to find a slightly more difficult trail that wouldn't be packed with tourists, and it ended up being great. Some parts of the climb were pretty challenging, and the entire thing took about 4 hours. At one point we hit a little waterfall, so I was able to dip my head under it (which was incredibly refreshing on the side of a mountain during a hike).

The top of the mountain was in a cloud, so there was no view at the top and it got cold quick. We took took the cable car down instead of hiking. It's basically a ski lift except with only one car that fits about 30 people.

It was a funny moment once we got to the top, because my roomate and I had a super tough, 4+ hour hike to the top eating granola bars and managing water supplies, and we didn't know what to expect at the peak. But once we got there, we see loads of people that just rode the cable car to the top, and were eating a meal in a wifi-lounge haha.
