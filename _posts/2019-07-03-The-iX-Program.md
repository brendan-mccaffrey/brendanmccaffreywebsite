## The Professor

The lady teaching the class is a South African native. She has a couple of years in the financial services industry, has a Masters, is CFA certified (kinda a benchmark in finance), and is currently pursuing a PhD. She is very smart, and is a good teacher.

## The class

The class itself is very interesting. We are just getting started, but we have a couple of cool projects coming up for which I'm excited.
I may also sneakily do the coding class as well. I can't attend both classes, because they are at the same time, but I think I'll try to do the coding homework along with the finance course.
