Matt made a reservation about two weeks ago for arguably the finest restaurant in South Africa, 
<a href="https://www.thetestkitchen.co.za/">The Test Kitchen</a>.
Five of us are going for dinner: Matt, Joanna (Tara knows her, also from Penn), Eli (A Penn 
computer science major in the year above me), Michael (my roomate and a "foodie"), and myself.
Since our class goes from 1-5, we are all wearing very fancy attire in class so we could go 
straight to dinner. 

I'll let you know about the food and the whole experience after we go.
