The Test Kitchen was incredible. We first sat in a small room on some fancy couches with a coffee table in the middle. We ordered cocktails asnd they brought out a map of the world. It had a path to several countries, with the name of the dish insipred by that country. they came out with a new dish about every 5 minutes, each had 5 little pieces of food, as we had five people in our group. 

The first dish was covered in 24K gold, and every single dish tasted absolutely amazing. After about 40 minutes, we were invited to the next room, win which we sat at a more traditional dinner table. WOver the course of about 3 and a half hours, we got about 8 more dishes each and the final dessert came with 24K gold plating as well.
