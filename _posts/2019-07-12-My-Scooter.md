Yesterday I got up early, so I decided to rent a scooter. I ubered to a place in the middle of the city, and I was able to get a scooter for the day. The scooter was super fun to drive, and it's the coolest way to get around in Cape Town, because the views are incredible. That's all I have for yesterday.

Also, I started attending a yoga class close to my apartment. It's on tuesday and friday mornings and I'm awful at it. 

I have a fun weekend planned too, more to come.
