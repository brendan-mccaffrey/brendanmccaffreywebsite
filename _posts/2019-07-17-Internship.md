I am in a group with five other finance students, working on making financial 
models for a company called <link href="https://www.m4jam.com/">M4Jam</link>. 
We are trying to determine how much they should charge for their services, but 
we don't have nearly enough information to come up with something, haha. 

I went skydiving on Sunday, we got there at 7:30am but werent able to jump until about 12 due to weather.
It was incredible! I am finally going to surf on Sunday, so I'm also excited for that. But for now, I'm 
trapped in this office from 8am-5pm.

I can't think of much else to say! I overall love Cape Town! Text me if there is anything you were wondering about that I missed.
