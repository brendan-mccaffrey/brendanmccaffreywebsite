Today is Tuesday, and I am currently sitting in class that goes from 1-5pm. I am going to a yoga class at 6, and possibly a food market after that. This past Saturday we had an excursion to the Langa Township, which is the first ghetto developed by the South African Government for black people before aparthide. We learned a little about the culture, and went through the community seeing people's homes and the awful conditions many people live in. It was a cool experience. 

On Sunday morning, the iX program got a bus for anyone that wanted to go surfing. We each got a board and wetsuit (the water is cold) and surfed for 2 hours. I felt like I was an amazing surfer, because the waves are perfect at this beach. I had so much fun that I might try to do the same exact thing this upcoming Sunday.

The weather is so awful right now that it's almost amazing: howling winds and heavy rain. I started reading a book, Crime and Punishment. It just might be the very first book I finish cover to cover in my life (if I end up finishing it). I only have two weekends left, and I'm determined to make the most of my time!
